<H2><A NAME="definition-internet"></A> <A NAME="s3">3.</A> <A HREF="networking-concepts-HOWTO.html#toc3">What is the `Internet'?</A></H2>

<P>The Internet is a 
<A HREF="networking-concepts-HOWTO-2.html#definition-WAN">WAN</A> which spans
the entire globe: it is the largest computer network in existence.
The phrase `internetworking' refers to connecting separate networks to
build a larger one, hence `The Internet' is the connection of a whole
pile of subnetworks.</P>

<P>So now we look at the list above and ask ourselves: what is the
Internet's size, physical details and protocols?</P>

<P>The size is already established above: it's global.</P>

<P>The physical details are varied however: each little sub-network is
connected differently, with a different layout and physical nature.
Attempts to map it in a useful way have generally met with abject
failure.</P>

<P>The protocols spoken by each link are also often different: all of
the 
<A HREF="networking-concepts-HOWTO-2.html#definition-link-level-protocol">link-level protocols</A> listed above are used, and many more.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1</A> <A HREF="networking-concepts-HOWTO.html#toc3.1">How Does The Internet Work?</A>
</H2>

<P>The question then arises: how come every node on the Internet can
talk to the others, if they all use different link-level protocols to
talk to each other?</P>
<P>
<A NAME="definition-network-protocol"></A> </P>
<P>The answer is fairly simple: we need another protocol which
controls how stuff flows through the network.  The link-level protocol
describes how to get from one node to another if they're connected
directly: the `network protocol' tells us how to get from one point in
the network to any other, going through other links if necessary.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="definition-internet-protocol"></A> 
<A NAME="definition-IP"></A> 
<A NAME="definition-IPv4"></A> 
<A NAME="definition-IPv6"></A> </P>
<P>For the Internet, the network protocol is the Internet Protocol
(version 4), or `IP'.  It's not the only protocol out there (Apple's
AppleTalk, Novell's IPX, Digital's DECNet and Microsoft's NetBEUI
being others) but it's the most widely adopted.  There's a newer
version of IP called IPv6, but it's still not common.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="definition-router"></A> </P>
<P>So to send a message from one side of the globe to another, your
computer writes a bit of Internet Protocol, sends it to your modem,
which uses some modem link-level protocol to send it to the modem it's
dialed up to, which is probably plugged into a terminal server
(basically a big box of modems), which sends it to a node inside the
ISP's network, which sends it out usually to a bigger node, which
sends it to the next node... and so on.  A node which connects two or
more networks is called a `router': it will have one 
<A HREF="networking-concepts-HOWTO-2.html#definition-network-interface">interface</A> for each
network.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="definition-protocol-stack"></A> </P>
<P>We call this array of protocols a `protocol stack', usually drawn
like so:</P>

<A NAME="definition-TCP"></A> 
So in the diagram, we see Netscape (the Application on top left)
retrieving a web page from a web server (the Application on top
right).  To do this it will use `Transmission Control Protocol' or
`TCP': over 90% of the Internet traffic today is TCP, as it is used
for Web and EMail.</P>

<P>So Netscape makes the request for a TCP connection to the remote
web server: this is handed to the TCP layer, which hands it to the IP
layer, which figures out which direction it has to go in, hands it
onto the appropriate link layer, which transmits it to the other end
of the link.</P>

<P>At the other end, the link layer hands it up to the IP layer, which
sees it is destined for this host (if not, it might hand it down to a
different link layer to go out to the next node), hands it up to the
TCP layer, which hands it to the server.</P>

<P>So we have the following breakdown:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI> The application (Netscape, or the web server at the other end)
decides who it wants to talk to, and what it wants to send).

<A NAME="definition-packets"></A> </LI>
<LI> The TCP layer sends special packets to start the conversation
with the other end, and then packs the data into a TCP
`packet': a packet is just a term for a chunk of data which
passes through a network.  The TCP layer hands this packet to
<A NAME="definition-retransmission"></A> 
the IP layer: it then keeps sending it to the IP layer until
the TCP layer at the other end replies to say that it has
received it.  This is called `retransmission', and has a whole
heap of complex rules which control when to retransmit, how
long to wait, etc.  It also gives each packet a set of numbers,
which mean that the other end can sort them into the right
order.

<A NAME="definition-routing"></A> </LI>
<LI> The IP layer looks at the destination of the packet, and
figures out the next node to send the packet to.  This simple
act is called `routing', and ranges from really simple (if you
only have one modem, and no other network interfaces, all
packets should go out that interface) to extremely complex (if
you have 15 major networks connected directly to you).</LI>
</OL>
