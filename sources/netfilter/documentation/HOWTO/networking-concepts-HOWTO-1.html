<P>Welcome, gentle reader.</P>

<P>I have written a number of networking HOWTOs in the past, and it
occurred to me that there's a hell of pile of jargon in each one.  I
had three choices: my other two were ignoring the problem and
explaining the terms everywhere.  Neither was attractive.</P>

<P>The <B>point</B> of Free software is that you should have the
freedom to explore and play with the software systems you use.  I
believe that enabling people to experience this freedom is a noble
goal; not only do people feel empowered by the pursuit (such as
rebuilding a car engine) but the nature of the modern Internet and
Free software allows you to share the experience with millions.</P>

<P>But you have to start somewhere, so here we are.</P>
