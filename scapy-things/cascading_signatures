The Cascading Signatures method, on the other hand, would reduce the number of packets on the network, but increase the amount of processing required per packet, as well as the packet's size. Some benchmarking would be required in a number of network conditions and topographies to determine which method gives a better performance, both in terms of native traffic and pollination. The Cascading Signatures does however give an advantage in that traffic captured live on the network would all contain a complete listing of the hosts it had visited, without need to search for an accompanying agent.
